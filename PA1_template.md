# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1




## Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
AMDdata<-read.csv(file="activity.csv")
```


```r
sumstepsperday<-tapply(AMDdata$steps,AMDdata$date,sum)
hist(sumstepsperday, main="Total steps per day", col="yellow",breaks = 10)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
meanstepsperday<-mean(sumstepsperday, na.rm=TRUE)
medianstepsperday<-median(sumstepsperday, na.rm=TRUE)
```
The mean is 1.0766\times 10^{4}, and the median is 10765

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


## need to be commited at least once
